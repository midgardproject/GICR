GObject Content Repository
==========================

GICR provides a standard set of content repository interfaces for GObjects. It is based on the Java Content Repository specification. [From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository_API_for_Java):

> Content Repository API for Java (JCR) is a specification for a Java platform application programming interface (API) to access content repositories in a uniform manner. The content repositories are used in content management systems to keep the content data and also the metadata used in content management systems (CMS) such as versioning metadata.

By using GICR APIs, a GObject-based application can use the standard interfaces for nodes, tree management, versioning and structured queries regardless of how the data is actually stored.

## Status

At this point GICR is in a proposal state and is being developed by the Midgard team. We hope other GNOME projects will also participate in this effort. For example, having a combined file system and Tracker implementation would be very useful.
